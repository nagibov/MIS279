# Business Model Canvas (BMC): From Zero to Your First Canvas

> Audience: students new to BMC • Goal: by the end, each student can build a complete BMC for a chosen business.

---

## Slide 1 — Title & Promise
**Business Model Canvas: turn ideas into one page**  
You’ll learn the 9 building blocks and build a complete canvas for a simple idea.

**We’ll use this example throughout:** *Campus Coffee Cart* (a mobile cart serving specialty coffee on campus).

**Speaker Notes**
- Keep it practical. The canvas is a shared language to explain how a business creates, delivers, and captures value.
- We’ll build block-by-block with the Coffee Cart, then you’ll do your own.

---

## Slide 2 — Outcomes & Agenda (60–75 min)
**Learning outcomes**
1) Explain each BMC block in plain English  
2) Fill the canvas for a real idea  
3) Identify riskiest assumptions & design simple tests

**Agenda**
- Why BMC? (5 min)  
- The 9 blocks (10 min)  
- Coffee Cart: build step-by-step (25–30 min)  
- Common mistakes & pro tips (5 min)  
- Your turn: build & share (15–25 min)

**Speaker Notes**
- If you have 90 min: add a short team exercise & quick feedback.

---

## Slide 3 — Why a Canvas (not a 40‑page plan)?
**Because** strategy changes fast. You need a one‑page, visual model everyone understands.
- Aligns teams with a **shared language**
- Makes assumptions **visible**
- Easy to **iterate & test**

**Speaker Notes**
- The canvas doesn’t replace thinking; it exposes it.

---

## Slide 4 — The 9 Building Blocks (map)
1. **Customer Segments**  
2. **Value Propositions**  
3. **Channels**  
4. **Customer Relationships**  
5. **Revenue Streams**  
6. **Key Resources**  
7. **Key Activities**  
8. **Key Partnerships**  
9. **Cost Structure**

**Speaker Notes**
- Right side = market/value. Left side = operations. Bottom = money.

---

## Slide 5 — Our Running Example
**Idea:** *Campus Coffee Cart*  
A small mobile cart serving high‑quality coffee to students and staff between classes.

**Assumptions we’ll test**  
- Students value speed + quality vs. cafeteria coffee  
- Ideal spots & times (8–11am near humanities, 1–3pm near library)  
- Price point 2.5–4.0

**Speaker Notes**
- Keep it simple and relatable; yours can be any idea.

---

## Slide 6 — 1) Customer Segments
**Definition:** The specific groups you serve.

**Guiding questions**
- Who has the problem? Who pays? Who uses?  
- Narrow first. Who are *early adopters*?

**Coffee Cart**
- Primary: Undergrad students rushing between classes  
- Secondary: Faculty & staff  
- Early adopters: Students near the main quad 8–11am

**Quick check**
- Can you list 1–2 *personas* with schedule & habits?

**Speaker Notes**
- Avoid “everyone.” Name 1–2 core segments to start.

---

## Slide 7 — 2) Value Propositions
**Definition:** The bundle of benefits you promise to a segment.

**Guiding questions**
- What job are customers trying to get done?  
- What pains do we remove? What gains do we create?

**Coffee Cart**
- *Faster than walking to the cafeteria*  
- *Better taste than vending machine coffee*  
- *Loyalty: buy 9, get 1 free (digital punch)*

**Format**  
"For [segment], who want [job], we provide [benefit] unlike [alternative]."

**Speaker Notes**
- Benefits, not features. Tie to a real job-to-be-done (caffeine + speed).

---

## Slide 8 — 3) Channels
**Definition:** How you reach and deliver value.

**Types**
- Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Delivery → After‑sales

**Coffee Cart**
- Awareness: Instagram, campus posters, student clubs  
- Purchase/Delivery: On‑site cart + QR ordering  
- After‑sales: DM feedback, loyalty reminders

**Speaker Notes**
- Be concrete: where exactly will they discover/order/receive?

---

## Slide 9 — 4) Customer Relationships
**Definition:** The type of relationship per segment.

**Modes**
- Personal assist • Self‑service • Automated • Community • Co‑creation

**Coffee Cart**
- Personal: names & regular orders  
- Automated: SMS/WhatsApp “ready in 3 min”  
- Community: limited seasonal flavors voted by students

**Speaker Notes**
- Relationships impact acquisition, retention, upsell.

---

## Slide 10 — 5) Revenue Streams
**Definition:** How the business earns money.

**Patterns**
- Unit sales • Subscriptions • Bundles • Ads • Licensing • Usage fees

**Coffee Cart (example prices)**
- Americano 2.5 • Latte 3.5 • Cold brew 3.8  
- Add‑ons: oat milk +0.5 • flavor +0.3  
- Bundle: “Morning pass” 5/day (Mon–Fri)

**Speaker Notes**
- Show pricing logic vs. alternatives (cafeteria, chain café, vending).

---

## Slide 11 — 6) Key Resources
**Definition:** Assets required to deliver value.

**Types**
- Physical • Human • Intellectual • Financial • Digital

**Coffee Cart**
- Cart, espresso machine, grinder, water supply  
- Trained baristas  
- QR ordering page + loyalty micro‑app  
- Startup float for inventory

**Speaker Notes**
- Ask: “Without this, we cannot deliver.”

---

## Slide 12 — 7) Key Activities
**Definition:** The most important things you must do.

**Coffee Cart**
- Sourcing beans & milk  
- Brewing & service during rush hours  
- Site selection & daily setup  
- Social posts & loyalty management

**Speaker Notes**
- Keep 3–6 activities. Everything else is noise.

---

## Slide 13 — 8) Key Partnerships
**Definition:** Who helps you deliver & reduce risk/cost.

**Coffee Cart**
- Bean roaster (quality + pricing)  
- Campus administration (permits, locations)  
- Payment provider (QR/terminal)  
- Equipment service (maintenance)

**Speaker Notes**
- Ask: “Buy vs. build?” and “Who already has what we need?”

---

## Slide 14 — 9) Cost Structure
**Definition:** All significant costs to run the model.

**Fixed vs. Variable**
- Fixed: permits, equipment lease, cart storage  
- Variable: beans, milk, cups, hourly staff, transaction fees

**Coffee Cart (illustrative)**
- Capex: cart + machine = 5,000–7,000  
- Gross margin target: 65–70% per drink

**Speaker Notes**
- Tie costs directly to resources/activities/partners.

---

## Slide 15 — Put It Together (Example Canvas)
**Campus Coffee Cart — Draft BMC**

| **Key Partners** | **Key Activities** | **Value Propositions** |
|---|---|---|
| Roaster, Campus admin, Payments, Equipment service | Brew & serve rush hours; Source supplies; Site selection; Social & loyalty | Faster than cafeteria; Better taste than vending; Mobile near classes; Loyalty free coffee |

| **Key Resources** | **Customer Relationships** | **Channels** |
|---|---|---|
| Cart + machine + inventory; Baristas; QR order page; Cash float | Personal recognition; Automated “ready” messages; Student‑voted flavors | On‑site cart; QR ordering; Instagram & clubs; Posters |

| **Cost Structure** | **Revenue Streams** | **Customer Segments** |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed: permits, equipment lease, storage; Variable: beans, milk, cups, labor, fees | Unit sales; Add‑ons; Morning pass | Primary: students (8–11am); Secondary: staff; Early adopters near main quad |

**Speaker Notes**
- This is a *first draft*. Next step: test assumptions with simple experiments.

---

## Slide 16 — Find Your Riskiest Assumptions
**Common risks**
- Demand at specific times/locations  
- Price elasticity  
- Permission to operate in hotspots  
- Service speed vs. queue length

**Fast tests (this week)**
- *Interviews:* 10 students on morning habits  
- *Pre‑orders:* Google Form + QR at hotspot  
- *POP‑UP:* 1‑day cart dry‑run with borrowed machine  
- *Willingness to pay:* A/B prices on two days

**Speaker Notes**
- Encourage cheap, fast experiments. Evidence beats opinions.

---

## Slide 17 — Patterns to Spark Ideas (optional)
- **Razor & blades** (low‑price device, profit on consumables)  
- **Subscription** (morning pass)  
- **Marketplace** (bundle with student events)  
- **Bundling** (coffee + pastry)

**Speaker Notes**
- Don’t force patterns. Use them to ideate alternatives.

---

## Slide 18 — Common Pitfalls & Pro Tips
**Pitfalls**
- “Everyone is our customer.”  
- Writing features, not benefits.  
- Listing all activities; missing the 3–6 that truly matter.  
- Pricing by cost alone (ignore alternatives/value).

**Pro tips**
- Start narrow, then expand.  
- Use sticky notes; move them as you learn.  
- Pair each block with **1 test** you can run this week.

---

## Slide 19 — Your Turn (15–25 min)
**Pick a simple idea** (solo or pairs). Examples:
- Laundry locker in dorms  
- Campus meal‑prep bowls  
- Note‑summary subscription for a tough course

**Instructions**
1) Draft your **Customer Segments** & **Value Proposition** first.  
2) Fill the remaining 7 blocks.  
3) Star ★ your **top 2 assumptions** and write **one test** for each.  
4) Prepare a 60‑second share.

**Deliverable**
- One‑page canvas + two test ideas.

---

## Slide 20 — Share & Feedback (5–10 min)
**Each team (60 sec):** Problem → Segment → Value → One risky assumption → One test  
**Peers & coach (60 sec):** 1 question, 1 suggestion.

**Speaker Notes**
- Timebox hard. Celebrate clarity & evidence.

---

## Slide 21 — Quick Reference: The 9 Blocks (cheat‑sheet)
- **Customer Segments:** Who exactly? Early adopters?  
- **Value Propositions:** Which pains/gains? Why better than alternatives?  
- **Channels:** How they discover, order, receive, and give feedback.  
- **Relationships:** Personal? Automated? Community?  
- **Revenue:** How you charge; price logic; lifetime value.  
- **Key Resources:** Assets you must have.  
- **Key Activities:** 3–6 actions you must nail.  
- **Key Partners:** Who helps reduce risk/cost?  
- **Costs:** Fixed vs. variable; unit economics.
